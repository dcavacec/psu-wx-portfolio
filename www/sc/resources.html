			<i>The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network.</i> One of the major 
			advantages of Perl is its strong community. This archive network 
			contains a multitude of modules to aid you in your various tasks. For 
			example, the <i>"WWW::Mechanize"</i> module makes browsing the web 
			with Perl quite simple. The <i>Date::Simple</i> module can help you in 
			creating a list of dates in a defined format, which is deceptively 
			tricky. Utilizing this archive is key because its exposes you to many 
			different facets of the language, it forces you to familiarize 
			yourself with object-oriented programming, and it is the core of the 
			power behind the Perl language.
