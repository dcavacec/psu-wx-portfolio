/* Tips for Elastic layouts 
1. Since the elastic layouts overall sizing is based on the user's default fonts size, they are more unpredictable. Used correctly, they are also more accessible for those that need larger fonts size since the line length remains proportionate.
2. Sizing of divs in this layout are based on the 100% font size in the body element. If you decrease the text size overall by using a font-size: 80% on the body element or the #container, remember that the entire layout will downsize proportionately. You may want to increase the widths of the various divs to compensate for this.
3. If font sizing is changed in differing amounts on each div instead of on the overall design (ie: #sidebar1 is given a 70% font size and #mainContent is given an 85% font size), this will proportionately change each of the divs overall size. You may want to adjust based on your final font sizing.

        <td height="359" colspan="2"><p>At Penn State's Spring 2008 Meteorology Career Days, I learned from several potential employers that a need for greater programming knowledge in meteorology graduates was becoming evident. With this discovery, I initiated the three-credit independent study option with Dr. George Young, Department of Meteorology professor and Information Technology and Weather Risk Management specialist. Following the suggestions of several industry leaders, we decided to utilize the Perl, Fortran, and VBA Excel programming languages to unveil historical temperature trend-length frequencies in State College. </p>
        <p>Perl was chosen for several reasons. Its compatibility with text data was ideal for collecting the historical temperatures because this information was most easily accessed via the PSU weather station page. Using pattern matching, regular expressions, and the browser agent community module<em> 'WWW::Mechanize,'</em> Perl did with ease what other languages would struggle to do. Retrieving all of the needed information was literally a matter of commanding the computer to visit each day's record individually, and record the findings in a text file. </p>
        <p>Fortran's extremely fast processing speed and popularity in the scientific research community made it ideal for the processing of the collected data. By designing a simple if-then-else loop to analyze the dataset, a histogram of temperature trend run-length was created and saved again as a text file. After coding was complete, the computation of three histograms describing over 100,000 temperature values took less than thirty seconds. </p>
        <p>Finally, Visual Basic for Excel was used to produce graphical output of the test results. Excel's ability to record macros and automatically code the associated script (like a WYSIWYG editor) made learning the VBA language easy. The processes of importing the histogram results, organizing them by temperature type, producing and formatting graphs, and exporting and saving images were all automated with VBA, and could be commenced upon  opening  the workbook. </p>
        <p>The significance of this project included raising my programmatic knowledge of three different coding languages to a functional level in less than two semesters, as well as gaining  insight to the way climatological analysis can lead to more accurate valuation of complex weather derivatives. Namely, that historical average, high, and low temperature <a href="../sc/index.html#results">trend frequencies</a> can be used to estimate the relevant probabilities of such derivative indices as long-term HDD and CDD contracts, or CAT contracts. NOTE: The data found on the results page linked above are not de-trended. </p></td>

        <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>This project involved using CBOT futures to manage the price risk associated with a purchase of 50,000 bushels of soybeans for a fictional meatless burger company. The ultimate goal was to correctly anticipate market price movement in the long term, and adjust the position to a maximum of 20 contracts net long or short in response to the forecasted change. To attain the  purchase, a net long position of 10 contracts had to be assumed by the final day of trading. This required an analysis of outside financial, commodity, energy, and currency markets, seasonal weather forecasts, historical analysis of May 2009 soybean futures price behaviors, and news regarding the fundamental factors affecting soybean economics, such as Argentine farmers' relationship with its government and the global stock of soybeans as the season progressed. </p>
        <p>The portfolio management in this project also required daily monitoring of account balances, which were marked-to-market each day, with an initial margin requirement of 4.725% and a maintenance requirement per contract of 3.5% of the total budget. This provided a valuable lesson about the need to carefully manage funds with margin requirements in mind, because a large price swing against net position could spell disaster. </p>
        <p>Finally, the length of the project (about three months) provided the trader with insight to the perils of short term trades made in response to daily news developments or changes in price direction. Volatility in the market on a daily or weekly scale is something that should be avoided by taking a position that reflects long term expectations of price development. In this way, fundamental and technical developments in conflict with the trader's expectations can be used as motivation to alter the position if needed. Acting solely as a reaction to such developments is a costly strategy, and successful price management requires anticipation based on history, and outside analysis. </p></td>

        <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top"><p>The ICE Brent crude oil futures trading project simulated the responsibilities of a speculative trader employed by a large hedge fund. Having been allocated $30M and restricted to making a total of 1,000  long and 1,000  short trades based on the settlement prices quoted daily on the Intercontinental Exchange's website, the team was tasked with generating the largest possible profit by making trades of sizes between 200 and 500 contracts. Increments of 100 contracts were required as well, which means a minimum of 4 and a maximum of 10 trades would be made of the duration of the project. The margin requirement of each contract was $10k, and this prompted traders to consider the pros and cons of each possible net position when making trade decisions. In addition, the calculation of final net gain was based on the average settlement prices of the short and long trades made. </p>
        <p>Completing this project within a group setting provided key insights to the implications of having several decision makers work toward the same goal. For example, group rules were established to prevent any discrepancy regarding the timing, magnitude, or general strategy involved with speculation. Each group member was assigned a specific title or position during the exercise as well, and this allowed the ultimate goal to be achieved through independent input as well as collaboration. </p></td>
